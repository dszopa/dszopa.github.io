# How I finally settled on a text editor (IN PROGRESS)

## The problem
With the large amount of text editors out there now a days, deciding what one to use has become more difficult
than ever.

My goal with this blog post is to shed some light on my search for ***the perfect text editor***
and to hopefully provide some insight for others as they try to decide what editor is best for them.

## The editors
Before I go through exactly what I decided upon I think that it is important to go over some of the most popular editors out there. As well as a few pros and cons of each editor.
